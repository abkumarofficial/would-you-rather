# Would You Rather Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The goal of this project is to better understand the working of Redux and getting a hands-on experience with a real world project.

## About the project
